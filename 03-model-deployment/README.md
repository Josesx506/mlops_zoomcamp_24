### Orchestration
A data preprocessing and prediction pipeline is developed with `mage` in a separate repo. <br><br>

Environment variables can be setup within mage to hide keys like the column names being preprocessed for security purposes. The docker environment was setup with a postgres db within a docker container for the purpose of the tutorial.
