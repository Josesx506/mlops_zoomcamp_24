### Project Description
Predict number of motor vehicle incidents based on `location_id | dayOfWeek | hourOfDay` in NYC. This can provide crash history alerts to drivers at the start of their journey (by modeling a preferred route between two points in this simple implementation) or dynamic alerts based on proximity to a specific location as the crow flies on their chosen routes. This project was inspired by a [Waze alert](https://blog.google/waze/crash-history-alerts-arrive-to-the-waze-map/) that I got on a recent journey.

### Setting up MLFlow Server
- Install packages to launch the environment
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt install python3-pip
    sudo python3 -m pip install awscli --break-system-packages
    aws configure              # Include access key and secret
    sudo apt install pipenv
    sudo apt install --reinstall python3-pkg-resources python3-setuptools
    pipenv shell
    pipenv install scikit-learn flask mlflow setuptools --python=3.12
    ```
- Start the server
    ```bash
    mlflow server --host 0.0.0.0 -p 5100 --backend-store-uri=sqlite:///mlflow.db --default-artifact-root=s3://mlflow-artifacts-joses/
    ```
- Set up inbound security rules to allow you access on the desired port, in this case `:5100`.
- Connect to the server using the instances public IP address. It should look something like `http://ec2-100-26-136-60.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5000`.
    > Note: `http://` should be used instead of `https://`. No **s** unless it won't connect.
- Now we're ready to start training the model.
